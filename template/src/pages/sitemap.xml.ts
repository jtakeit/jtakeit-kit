/**
 * The pages are written by hand in `PAGES` rather than generated, so that
 * adding a page and forgetting to list it is a visible omission in one file
 * instead of a silent one across the build.
 *
 * The entries are not, and cannot be: nobody writes them here — the owner makes
 * them in the admin — so they are read from the collections, which is the only
 * list of them that exists. A hidden entry is absent, because `allListed` is
 * how anything here enumerates them.
 *
 * With INDEXABLE off the file is still served, but empty — an empty sitemap
 * says «nothing to crawl», where a 404 says «try again later».
